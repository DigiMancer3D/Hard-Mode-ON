Welcome to Hard Mode (ON).

There are 2 basic ways to play HMO, you can either use the provided file sets or self-save by recreating all the game files yourself. Below will be instructions on how to play HMO for both methods.

1) Using the Provided Files:

	- Copy the provided folder titled "HMO".

	- Locate your "Zomboid" folder (normally at \\user\[your_name]\Zomboid\, if you can't find it search for "Zomboid").
	
	- Enter the "Saves" folder then into the "Sandbox" folder.

	- Paste the "HMO" folder you copied at step1.

	- Open "HMO" folder into a new window or instance of your file explorer.

	- Make sure you have the mod, "Mods Manager" from the mods list provided within Project Zomboid. 

	- Locate the folder "Lua" in your "Zomboid" folder (from step2) & enter "Lua" folder. If you don't use the "Mods Manager" mod then just drop to the next step.  Locate the file, "modmanager-mods.txt" & rename to, "modmanager-mods.txt_backup" by only adding "_backup" this will allow you to keep any presaves you already have and to restore your previous mod manager presaves just remove "modmanager-mods.txt" from the "Lua" folder and in the same folder rename, "modmanager-mods.txt_backup" to "modmanager-mods.txt" by removing the "_backup". You can open the original "modmanager-mods.txt" file and add in the new data but you also have to change the data alignment number by adding one to the last seen set before the one you are adding in.

	- Return to the provided files folder titled "Hard Mode (ON)", copy the file "modmanager-mods.txt" & paste this copied file into the "Lua" folder that's in the main "Zomboid" folder.

	- Go Back to the provided files to enter the folder titled "HMO (weeks)" then into "wk2".

	- Load up Project Zomboid (PZ).

	- Click "Load" and load up "HMO".

	- Now when in the pause screen or on the death screen when the "day's since" counter says "7", you need to pause then copy the "map_sand.bin" file from "wk2" folder you have open and paste it into the Project Zomboid live game folder. The live game folder in this case will be the "HMO" folder you pasted into "Sandbox" folder that is in the "Saves" folder within the "Zomboid" folder for the game. If you followed the instructions earlier you already have the "HMO" folder open in it's own instance/explorer-window. So you can drag and drop the "map_sand.bin" file from "wk2" to "HMO" to replace the file. You may have to enter a password or click to replace the file but when the new "map_sand.bin" is in the folder that will update the game's settings. Every in-game week you drag and drop from the next week (wk) folder into your game and the game instantly get's updated to the new difficulty.


2) Self-Save:

First, Open the provided folder, "Special Data for HMO (Self-Save)". In here are some folder and files. Below will explain what's in each and what they are for.

 	- The folder: "Initator Swap Map Settings File (should be 1 file map_sand.bin)" contains the example file you will be pulling from your game save files to swap during game play. You can use the provided file to start any game to turn into HMO even if it doesn't have all the same mods just by dragging that file into a game save folder while that game save is running.

	- The folder: "Sandbox Presets" contains presets for each week that you can drag the internal files into your game's Project Zomboid's "Sandbox Presets" folder in the main "Zomboid" folder. This will allow you to be able to just click and set your sandbox settings to the desired week. You'll have to start a game for each week and then after leaving that game go into the game save folder and copy the "map_sand.bin" file. Do this for all 12 weeks.

	- The file: "mods.txt" is the game provided file that shows what mods are used by the name provided by the game files. Some of the mods are hard to find from this and you have to search for the number in the link if a name is a link that goes to a 404 error.

	- The file: "Sandbox Options (weeks 1-12).xlsx" is an excell file that contians all the sandbox options for the game and mods for each of the 12 weeks. Use this to configure your game if you want to do it by hand to customize things further.

	- The file: "Starter Kits HMO.txt" is a text file of how the starter kit mod which changes the inital loadout for each profession instead of using the preset "Starter Kits" from within the standard game presets. In the file, "Sandbox Options (weeks 1-12).xlsx" for the mod this file is for it will redirect to a potentially misspelled or missnamed file which is this "Starter Kits HMO.txt" file.

	- The file: "thumb.png" is a file you can use to setup the game save thumbnail after the game save has been made. Normally the game makes this a screenshot of the last seen scene but replacing your non-live game files thumb.png with this one should update the seen thumbnail for the game save in the Project Zomboid game. Perfect for streamers to not show their previous results.
